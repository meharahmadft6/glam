            The Ultimate Guide to Waxing: Achieve Smooth Skin with GlamByHa
          </h3>
          <p class="text-gray-600 mt-2">
            Waxing is one of the most popular hair removal techniques, and for
            good reason. It removes hair from the root, leaving your skin silky
            smooth for weeks. At <strong>GlamByHa</strong>, owned by the
            renowned beautician <strong>Nazia Parveen</strong>, we specialize in
            providing top-notch waxing services tailored to your needs. Whether
            you're looking for full body waxing or targeting specific areas, our
            expert techniques ensure minimal discomfort and long-lasting
            results.

            <li>
              <strong>Long-Lasting Results:</strong> Unlike shaving, waxing
              removes hair from the root, meaning you can enjoy smooth skin for
              up to 4-6 weeks.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Exfoliation:</strong> Waxing also removes dead skin cells,
              leaving your skin feeling soft and rejuvenated.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Reduced Hair Growth:</strong> With regular waxing, you may
              notice that your hair grows back thinner and sparser over time.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Precision:</strong> Our skilled beauticians ensure that

            <strong>What is a Lash Lift?</strong>
          </p>
          <p class="text-gray-600 mt-2">
            A lash lift is similar to a **perm for your eyelashes**, but safer
            and more natural-looking. It lifts and curls your lashes from the
            root, creating a longer and fuller appearance without any damage.
            Unlike traditional lash curlers, which can weaken your lashes, a
            professional lash lift is gentle and maintains lash health.
          </p>

            <li>
              <strong>Natural Enhancement:</strong> No need for mascara or lash
              curlers—your lashes will look naturally lifted and voluminous.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Long-Lasting Results:</strong> A lash lift can last **6-8
              weeks** with proper care, making it a low-maintenance beauty
              solution.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Quick & Painless Procedure:</strong> The treatment takes
              only **45-60 minutes**, with no downtime required.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Customizable Curl:</strong> At **GlamByHa**, we offer

            <li>
              <strong>Consultation:</strong> We analyze your lash length,
              thickness, and eye shape to determine the best curl type for you.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Cleansing & Preparation:</strong> Your lashes are
              thoroughly cleaned to remove any oil or makeup residue.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Shield Placement:</strong> A silicone shield is placed on
              your eyelid to shape the lash curl.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Lifting Solution:</strong> A safe lifting solution is
              applied to break down the lash bonds and reshape them.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Setting & Nourishing:</strong> A setting solution locks in
              the curl, followed by a **keratin treatment** to strengthen
              lashes.

            <li>
              <strong>Cleansing:</strong> Use a gentle cleanser to remove dirt

            <li>
              <strong>Toning:</strong> Helps balance skin's pH and prepares it

            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Exfoliating:</strong> Exfoliate 2-3 times a week to remove
              dead skin cells and reveal a brighter complexion.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Serums:</strong> Target concerns like hydration,
              brightening, or anti-aging with ingredients like hyaluronic acid
              or vitamin C.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Moisturizing:</strong> Lock in moisture with a suitable
              moisturizer for soft and supple skin.
            </li>
            <li>

            Eyebrow Threading: The Best Way to Shape and Define Your Brows
          </h3>
          <p class="text-gray-600 mt-2">
            Eyebrow threading is a precise and effective method for shaping and
            defining your brows. At <strong>GlamByHa</strong>, owned by the
            expert beautician <strong>Nazia Parveen</strong>, we specialize in
            this ancient technique to give you perfectly arched brows.

          <p class="text-gray-600 mt-2 font-semibold">
            What is Eyebrow Threading?
          </p>
          <p class="text-gray-600 mt-2">
            Eyebrow threading is a hair removal technique using a thin, twisted
            cotton thread to remove unwanted hair from the root. Unlike waxing
            or tweezing, threading is gentle on the skin and suitable for all
            skin types.
          </p>

          <p class="text-gray-600 mt-4 font-semibold">
            Benefits of Eyebrow Threading:
          </p>
          <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-gray-600 mt-2 space-y-2">
            <li>
              <strong>Precision:</strong> Threading allows for detailed shaping,
              creating clean and symmetrical brows.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Gentle on Skin:</strong> Unlike waxing, threading doesn't
              pull on the skin, making it ideal for sensitive skin.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Long-Lasting:</strong> Hair is removed from the root, so
              results can last up to 4-6 weeks.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>No Chemicals:</strong> A natural method without any
              chemicals or creams.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Exfoliation:</strong> Removes dead skin cells, leaving the
              area smooth and refreshed.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p class="text-gray-600 mt-4 font-semibold">
            Why Choose Threading Over Other Methods?
          </p>
          <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-gray-600 mt-2 space-y-2">
            <li>
              <strong>Waxing:</strong> Can irritate the skin and cause redness.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Tweezing:</strong> Less precise and time-consuming.</li>
            <li>
              <strong>Shaving:</strong> Temporary results and can lead to
              thicker hair growth over time.
            </li>

            <li>
              <strong>Avoid Touching:</strong> Prevent irritation by not
              touching your brows immediately after threading.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Moisturize:</strong> Keep the area hydrated with a gentle
              moisturizer.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Regular Maintenance:</strong> Schedule threading
